Sorry these were not entered by the deadline.

1.	Vol 1 X.3.2 says the Health Information Exchange is virtual. As a purchaser, that does not help me when reading an Integration Statement or writing an RFP. You should enumerate which actors can receive this data and show the transactions that support this.

2.	Vol 1, Table X.3-1 lists the transactions for the various actors. The Option column is an interesting addition, but does not follow the norm for this table. You should use the standard table layout, even if yours is “better”.

3.	Vol 1, Table X.4-1 lists actors/options. The actors in this table do not match the set of actors in X.3-1 or the diagram. Even if an actor has no options, it should be listed in this table. You did that for Enterprise Report Repository (good), but omitted some others.

4.	PCC-0 defines a new structure that is not supported in the profile template. You should use the existing formats and place options on the PHR. It is simple enough to have a named option to identify how this will be transmitted. As a customer, that is easier to manage.
